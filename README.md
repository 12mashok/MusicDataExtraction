# music-data-extraction
Automates musical data extraction from the Numbers Into Notes website.

## About ##
This python scripts automates musical data extraction from the Numbers Into Notes website, an algorithmic music composition website written by Professor David De Roure to encourage discussion about music, mathematics, and programming. This allows for ease of large-scale data extraction of algorithmic
music for use as a music signal generator.

The python script uses Selenium Webdriver to automate data extraction. The user can specify their choice of music generation algorithm along with their parameters (if any) and the modulo number that reduces the output to a musical sequence. The notes and their respective octaves are returned by the script.
